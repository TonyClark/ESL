                <p> ESL is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor
                    language</a> that has been designed to run applications and
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">simulations</a>
                  that require information-rich processing by autonomous
                  computational units. Each actor runs in its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29">thread
                    of control</a> and communicates with other actors using <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication">asynchronous
                    messages</a>. ESL supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern-matching</a>,

                    functions</a>. Applications in ESL are highly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing">concurrent</a>
                  and are driven by system generated time-events. ESL can
                  support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking">sense-making</a>
                  of applications and simulations by generating state histories
                  that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_log">record
                    computation steps</a>; once generated, a history can be
                  interrogated using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">temporal-logic</a>
                  based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language">query
                    language</a>. ESL has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">static
                    type system</a> that includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric

                  <br>
                  ESL application development is supported by a tool called EDB
                  that provides real-time support for syntax and type checking.
                  EDB can be used to create and manage an ESL application
                  including its execution, debugging and history management. EDB
                  allows ESL to generate graphical representations of running
                  applications and of their histories.<br>
                  <br>
                  ESL source code is compiled to run on a virtual machine
                  implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>
                  and provides support for Java classes to be integrated with
                  ESL applications by implementing an actor interface. EDB is
                  implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>
                  and uses a collection of open source libraries in addition to
                  <a href="http://www.teamdev.com/jxbrowser">JxBrowser</a> for
                  HTML and SVG support. The use of JxBrowser is governed by the

          <div> Dining philosophers can be implemented in ESL so that each
            philosopher is an actor that needs to grab two chopsticks in order
            to eat. A co-ordination mechanism must be used in the form of data
            locks so that two chopsticks are grabbed at a time, otherwise the
            philosophers can deadlock and starve. ESL can turn an execution
            history into a filmstrip that is shown as a picture. Dragging the
            marker left and right moves forward and backward through the
            execution showing that no deadlock occurs: </div>

          <div> Pacman is a game where the player controls the movement through
            a maze of the yellow pacman who wants to eat all the food, and where
            the system controls the ghosts who are seeking to eat the pacman.
            All the ghosts are actors who move independently of the pacman that
            is controlled by the user via the mouse. The ghosts implement a
            suitable strategy by inspecting the current state of the world and
            making a decision about their next move: </div>

          <div> A road junction is controlled by a pair of traffic lights. Cars
            travel with greater frequency right to left and therefore they
            should be given priority. However, the lights should monitor the
            situation so that the queue from the left does not become too long.
            This example shows how ESL can be used to implement data monitors
            where the traffic lights are actors and monitors are actors that
            trigger changes based on the execution history of the junction
            queues. </div>

            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/traffic.png" alt=""></a>

          <div> The ESL traffic light application on the right shows the type
            definitions for the actors and part of the traffic light behaviour
            definition. </div>
          <div> ESL can be used to define a simulation. A shop wishes to try out
            different arrangements of of tills and assistants based on
            simulations of customer behaviour. Customers enter the shop and may
            seek help choosing goods before waiting at a queue to pay. If a
            customer waits too long for assistance or waits too long in a queue
            at a till then they will abandon their purchase and leave the shop.

          <div> A model of the imulation can be implemented as ESL types... </div>
          <div> ... or as a structure model.... </div>
          <div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <div> ... together with a behaviour model. </div>
          <div> ESL can display a graphical description of the state of the
            simulation as it occurs. The display on the right shows the state of
            the customers in the simulation and the current state of their
            satisfaction (how many have left after failing to make a purchase).
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/customers.jpg"
                  alt=""></a>

          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/shop_filmstrip.png"
                  alt=""></a>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div> As the shop simulation runs it can save a history of actor
            states producing a filmstrip. The filmstrip can be transformed into
            a series of pictures by ESL and displayed in EDB. The snapshot shows
            a number of assistants waiting on the floor, some criminal customers
            tying up the assistants in the hope that their accomplices can steal
            goods from the shop. Four of the tills have queues of customers
            waiting to make a purchase. </div>
          <div> Actors often need to make plans that control how they respond to
            changes in their environment. A simple example is a collection of
            travellers on the underground who are given the task of travelling
            between different stations. ESL provides a logic programming
            language that is used in the example to implement a STRIPS-like
            planner. </div>
          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/underground_code.png"
                  alt=""></a>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/underground.png"
                  alt=""></a>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div> Each of the traveller actors run autonomously. The user can
            click on underground stations to blow them up. A traveller passing
            through a blown-up station is removed from the system. The state of
            the underground is transformed within ESL as a graph that is
            displayed by EDB. </div>
          <div> A world consists of two different tribes. Members of a tribe
            want to be located near members of the same tribe and will feel
            uncomfortable if too many strangers surround them. If a member is
            uncomfortable then they will move to a vacant location at random.
            The starting pint of the simulation is shown where each tribe member
            is an independent actor. </div>
          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/segregation_before.png"
                  alt=""></a>
            </div>

          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/segregation_after.png"
                  alt=""></a>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div> After the simulation has run for a period of time, all the tribe
            members become comfortable and no further moves occur. </div>
          <div> Predator-prey is a standard multi-agent application where
            predator actors try to catch the prey actors who in turn try to
            escape. Each type of actor must implement a strategy that achieves
            their goals. A predator is an actor that grabs the board, inspects
            the current tiuation and determines which direction they should
            move. </div>
          <div>
            <div class="image fit"> <a href="#"><img src="images/predator_code.png"
                  alt=""></a>

            </div>
          </div>
          <div> A prey is an actor that grabs the board and tries to move away
            from all the predators. </div>
          <div> The predator-prey application conforms to a filmstrip pattern
            that can be encoded in ESL and that supports any application that
            satisfies given critera. The following two snapshots are generaed by
            the general pattern. </div>
