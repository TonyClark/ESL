                <p> ESL is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor

                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">simulations</a>
                  that require information-rich processing by autonomous
                  computational units. Each actor runs in its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29">thread
                    of control</a> and communicates with other actors using <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication">asynchronous
                    messages</a>. ESL supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching">pattern-matching</a>,

                  and are driven by system generated time-events. ESL can
                  support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking">sense-making</a>
                  of applications and simulations by generating state histories

                  based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language">query

                  ESL application development is supported by a tool called EDB
                  that provides real-time support for syntax and type checking.
                  EDB can be used to create and manage an ESL application
                  including its execution, debugging and history management. EDB
                  allows ESL to generate graphical representations of running
                  applications and of their histories.<br>
                  <br>
                  ESL source code is compiled to run on a virtual machine
                  implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>
                  and provides support for Java classes to be integrated with
                  ESL applications by implementing an actor interface. EDB is
                  implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>
                  and uses a collection of open source libraries in addition to

            Dining philosophers can be implemented in ESL so that each
            philosopher is an actor that needs to grab two chopsticks in order
            to eat. A co-ordination mechanism must be used in the form of data
            locks so that two chopsticks are grabbed at a time, otherwise the
            philosophers can deadlock and starve. ESL can turn an execution
            history into a filmstrip that is shown as a picture. Dragging the
            marker left and right moves forward and backward through the
            execution showing that no deadlock occurs.

            Pacman is a game where the player controls the movement through
            a maze of the yellow pacman who wants to eat all the food, and where
            the system controls the ghosts who are seeking to eat the pacman.
            All the ghosts are actors who move independently of the pacman that
            is controlled by the user via the mouse. The ghosts implement a
            suitable strategy by inspecting the current state of the world and
            making a decision about their next move.

            A road junction is controlled by a pair of traffic lights. Cars
            travel with greater frequency right to left and therefore they
            should be given priority. However, the lights should monitor the
            situation so that the queue from the left does not become too long.
            This example shows how ESL can be used to implement data monitors
            where the traffic lights are actors and monitors are actors that
            trigger changes based on the execution history of the junction
            queues.

          <div> ESL can be used to define a simulation. A shop wishes to try out
            different arrangements of of tills and assistants based on
            simulations of customer behaviour. Customers enter the shop and may
            seek help choosing goods before waiting at a queue to pay. If a
            customer waits too long for assistance or waits too long in a queue
            at a till then they will abandon their purchase and leave the shop.
            EDB is used to create a dashboard that shows the current state of 
            each shopper during their visit to the shop.

            Segregation is a classic multi-agent simulation showing what happens in
            a typed society when there is slight bias towards co-locating with 
            agents of the same type. The society starts of with randomly distributed
            agents typed red and blue. If the location of an agent is surrounded by
            agents of a different type then they will move to a random unoccupied
            location. Given a slight bias towards moving from a location, the simulation
            shows that the society becomes segregated as shown in the resulting pattern 
            on the right.

          <div> Predator-prey is a typical multi-agent application with two types
                of agent. A predator is trying to catch a prey in a world that contains
                obstacles and places for the oprey to hide. In the example, the wolves
                are trying to catch the sheep who can hide behind rocks. ESL runs the
                scenario and builds a filmstrip of the states of the game. Once 
                completed EDB displays the filmstrip that can be played forwards and
                back to see how the prey evaded capture (or not!).

            ESL supports integration with Java so that third-party libraries such 
            as graphics can easily be integrated. In addition, EDB knows about particular
            Java interfaces so that a Java graphics component can be created within
            an ESL application and then displayed as an EDB tab as shown on the right.
            The application represents balls as ESL actors that check the world for
            collisions against the walls and other actors. The application is controlled
            using Swing buttons that communicate with ESL when they are pressed.

            ESL is a functional language that makes it easy to represent structured data.
            In addition, EDB integrates with a number of external libraries for data visualisation.
            The example shows a graph-colouring algorithm that first colours the graph and
            then displays it using GraphViz.

            Map/Reduce is a good example of data processing that can be implemented using
            concurrent processes. Data from many different sources is processed in parallel
            and given a key. Data with the same keys are then merged and finally reduced to 
            produce a result. The independence of the initial data and then of the keys
            provides scope for increasing the efficiency of producing the result.

            Termites is a nice example of emergent behaviour. The forest contains randomly distributed twigs.
            Termites like twigs and seek them out by moving at random. A termite will only pick up a twig if it not bounded by
            other twigs. Once it has picked up a twig, a termite will move randomly until it finds a location that
            is surrounded by several twigs. Then the termite drops the twig and starts over. Over time, the termites
            tidy the forest and produce piles of twigs, even though they have no knowledge of their overall
            collaborative task.
