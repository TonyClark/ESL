    <h1>Papers and Reports</h1>
    <p align="justify">The motivation for ESL is to produce an
      executable modelling environment that supports simulations of
      organizations. The origins of this work started around 2010 with
      the development of a modelling language called LEAP that was based
      on a variation of UML. LEAP developed into a collection of
      techniques and an associated tool-set that was used to model,
      simulate and analyze organizations and various organizational
      use-cases. The core of the LEAP tool-set was a component-based
      simulation language based on events. Concurrently, we started to
      develop a vision for the Model Driven Organization (MDO) and how
      decision-making could be supported by allowing organizational
      goals to be checked against simulation runs. Analysis of the
      technology requirements for these research challenges led us to
      propose that executable organizational models for organizational
      analysis and decision-making can be supported by an actor-language
      that has produced ESL. <br>
