    <p style="text-align:justify;font-family:
      Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-family:
        Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">EDB allows you to browse,
        create, edit and run ESL applications.</span>The ESL development
      environment is
      called EDB. It supports the development, execution and debugging
      of ESL
      applications. ESL is an Actor-based language. An actor is an
      independent
      computational unit that runs in its own thread. An actor has a
      message
      queue; messages sent to an actor are queued until the actor is
      ready to
      consume the message causing a new actor-thread to be created for
      the message.
      Actors have state that they can change, and can send messages to
      other actors.
      Actor state can be private or shared. At regular fixed intervals,
      all ESL
      actors receive a message telling them the current time. The time
      messages allow
      the actors to synchronise and are used to drive an ESL
      application. Think of
      an ESL application as a community of communicating actors that are
      synchronised
      by time messages.</p>
    <h2><font face="Arial"><u>ESL Application Life-Cycle</u></font></h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The EDB
        life-cycle for
        an ESL application is shown below:</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"><img
        alt="" src="execute.png"></p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">An ESL application is a
        collection of files with a main file that is loaded onto the ESL
        Virtual
        Machine. Loading a main file causes the file and any file that
        it imports to be
        compiled and checked. Subsequent loading will check whether a
        file has been
        changed and will only re-load if the file has been modified. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Once an application has been
        loaded, it must be initialized. Initialization causes the main
        actor to be
        created ready for execution. After initialization you will see
        an actor called
        'main' created in the panel labelled 'Actors' in the EDB window.
        You can run
        the initializer for an application by clicking on <img
          alt="init" src="../../icons/init.png" width="15" height="15">
        or by stepping by clicking
        <img alt="step" src="../../icons/step.png" width="15"
          height="15">.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Once initialized, the
        application is ready to run. You can run an application by
        selecting <img alt="Run" src="../../icons/run.png" width="15"
          height="15"> in which case it
        will run until it completes or until it hits a break-point that
        you have
        inserted. You can step an application by selecting <img
          alt="step" src="../../icons/step.png" width="15" height="15">
        in which case the
        application will advance to the next line in the source code.
        You can stop a
        running application by clicking on <img alt="stop"
          src="../../icons/stop.png" width="15" height="15">. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Any output from the application will
      be sent to
      the console. You can clear the console using the right-click menu
      on the
      console background.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Arial"><u>Working with

    <p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The browser-tree on the left
        shows a view on the file system rooted at the folder supplied as
        the first
        startup argument to the EDB Java application. The browser shows
        only those
        files that are meaningful to EDB. You can perform the following
        operations via
        right-click menus in the browser:</span></p>
    <ul style="text-align:justify;">
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Create a
          new file. Change the name of the file by double-clicking on
          the node in the tree and typing the new name in the selected
          text. Careful to include the file-extension.</span></li>
      <li style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Create a new
        folder. Change the name as above.</li>
      <li style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Delete a file.</li>
      <li style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Delete a

      <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Open a
          file by double-clicking on the file in the browser.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Drag and
          drop files and folders.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Click on
          a selected file or folder to get a text editor on the name.<br>
        </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Arial">When you open a
        file an editor
        is created showing the contents of the file. If the file is of
        type '.esl' then
        the editor will show any parse-errors using a red underline
        roughtly where the
        parse error is located. Hover over the red line using the mouse
        to bring up a diagnostic message that described the reason for
        the error.</font></p>
    <font face="Arial">
    </font>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><font face="Arial">When you have
        finished editing
        the file in the editor, you can load and run the file via a
        right-click menu.
        Loading the file will only be successful if the file does not
        contain
        errors. If the file imports any other applications then they
        will also
        be loaded. Loading occurs once and then caches the resulting
        module. The module
        will only be reloaded if the source code has changed and you
        cause a load
        request. </font></p>
    <font face="Arial">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Arial">Once loaded, a module must be initialized. The
        initialization will create an
        instance of the actor called 'main' which must be defined and
        exported from the
        loaded module:</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <hr>
    <pre>  import 'm.esl';
  export main;
  
  act main {
    Time(t) -&gt; {
      print('stop at time ' + t);
      stopAll()
    }
  }
</pre>
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:
        Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The example shown above is a
        single module that imports the module defined in the file m.esl.
        Since it is a
        module that defines and exports a behaviour called main, it can
        be loaded,
        initialized and executed. When the module is initialised it will
        create an
        actor with the behaviour named main and then all actors will be
        sent Time(n)
        messages at regular intervals. Assuming that m.esl is empty, the
        example above
        will receive the first Time message, print a message and then
        call the system
        function stopAll() which immediately stops the execution.<br>
